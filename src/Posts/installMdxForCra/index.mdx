Recently I ran across [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), and I'm an instant fan of it.
I am using it now to write this up in a few short minutes.

This article is how to install MDX with Typescript using create-react-app.
It is not going to use any server, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which do give you more options, but add extra steps at deployment.
It assumes familiarity with [create-react-app](https://es.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

The MDX project has reasonable documentation, but I took a couple of wrong turns during the setup.
All the necessary information is in the official docs, but there is some apparently outdated info as well.

So, let's get started.

### Install with CRA

Follow the steps in the GitHub guide to get started: 
https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/main/docs/getting-started/create-react-app.mdx

Do not follow the info on their [site](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/create-react-app).
It refers to mdx.macro, which appears unmaintained, and caused a number of issues, 
such as making mdx imports difficult, and various rendering inconsistencies.

### Add Typescript

1. As described in CRA's [Adding TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/), run

```bash
npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

or

```bash
yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

2. Rename `App.js` to `App.tsx`.

This causes an error like:

```markup
Cannot find module '!babel-loader!@mdx-js/loader!./Content.mdx' or its corresponding type declarations.ts(2307)
```

at

```jsx
import Content from '!babel-loader!@mdx-js/loader!./Content.mdx'
```

3. To fix the above error, we use the solution described in [Adding TypeScript](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/typescript).

Create `mdx.d.ts` in the `src` directory, and add the following content.  
Using the `src` directory allows it to be picked up without any further changes.

```jsx
declare module '*.mdx' {
  let MDXComponent: (props: any) => JSX.Element
  export default MDXComponent
}
```

The solution given in [GitHub](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/blob/main/docs/advanced/typescript.mdx) did not work for me.

4. To use `MDXProvider` without Typescript errors, run the following. 


```bash
yarn add @types/mdx-js__react
```

Note that the `code` component had no effect when used directly, ie without [MDXProvider](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#mdxprovider).
However, when using `MDXProvider`, it worked as expected.

* The application should now be usable.
