### An Input with Inline Label

When creating form contols, it is standard practice to create a label and an input.
`label for` is good for accessibility, and applications such as screen readers can use it.
Note that the `input` and `label` are related via the `label for`/ `input id` pair, not order or proximity.


```jsx
<label for="add-l1">Address Line 1: </label>
<input id="add-l1" type="text" name="address-line-1" value={managedValue} />
```

<div style={{ padding: '16px', backgroundColor: '#ddd', display: 'inline-flex', }}>
  <label for="add-l1">Address Line 1: </label>
  <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
  <input id="add-l1" type="text" name="address-line-1" />
</div>

A major downside is the screen space consumed.
So, one approach is to shift the label over the control.
This can provide a much cleaner interface.
Try entering text in the input below.

<AddressInput />

### Using the New Control

One nice thing about this implementation is that you only need to change `input` to the new `InputText` control,
and pass the label as a property.
There should not be any need to adjust positioning.
Note that the input must be a [controlled input](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).
In other words, a change to its value must trigger a render.

As such, to use the new `input`, you would only need to make simple changes.

```jsx
<label for="add-l1">Address Line 1: </label>
<input id="add-l1" type="text" name="address-line-1" value={controlledValue} />
```

becomes

```jsx
<InputText id="add-l1" type="text" name="address-line-1" value={controlledValue} label="Address Line 1" />
```

And, if no `label` or `id` was present,

```jsx
<input type="text" name="address-line-1" value={controlledValue} />
```

becomes

```jsx
<InputText type="text" name="address-line-1" value={controlledValue} label="Address Line 1" />
```

### Implementing the New Control

So, now we should write the new control.

First, if you don't have [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) already, then run the following to get a utility which we use.

```bash
yarn add lodash.uniqueid @types/lodash.uniqueid
```

Now for the implementation.

```tsx
/* ./InputText.tsx */

import _ from "lodash";
import { FunctionComponent, InputHTMLAttributes, memo, useState } from "react";
import './Input.css';

export interface InputTextProps extends Omit<InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>, 'placeholder'> {
    label: string,
}

const InputText: FunctionComponent<InputTextProps> = ({
    ...props
}) => {

    const [newId] = useState(_.uniqueId('gen-'));
    const id = props.id ?? newId;

    const className = `input-container${props.value == null || props.value ===''?'':' has-value'}`

    return (
        <span className={className}>
            <input id={id} {...props} />
            <label htmlFor={id}>{props.label}</label>
        </span>
    );
}

export default memo(InputText);
```

```css
/* ./Input.css */

.input-container {
    position: relative;
    display: inline-block;
}

.input-container > input {
    width: 160px;
    height: 36px;
    padding: 10px 6px 0px 6px;
    margin: 4px;
    border: 1px solid #222;
    border-radius: 4px;
    background-color: white;
}

.input-container > label {
    position: absolute;
    top: 12px;
    left: 12px;
    transition: 0.2s;
    color: #666;
    white-space: nowrap;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    width: 100%;
    pointer-events: none;
}

.input-container > input:focus + label, .input-container.has-value > label {
    top: 6px;
    left: 10px;
    font-size: 12px;
    color: blue;
}
```

* The `InputText` control creates a continer which holds both the actual `input` and the `label`.

* The container is `inline-block` and `relative`, which allows positioning of the child elements,
but does not interfere with pre-existing CSS styling.
[In another article](/post/post/how-to-animate-input-borders), a `flex` approach is used.

* The `InputText` control accepts all the parameters which an `input` can,
and just forwards those to its `input` in the HTML document.
Note that it actually excludes `placeholder`, because `placeholder` would conflict with the positioned `label`.

* The other parameter which `InputText` accepts is a `label text`, which it uses when creating the `label`.

* Because the implementation is largely CSS driven, the `label` is placed after the `input`.
This is because we want the CSS to position the `label` based on the `input` being selected,
and CSS selectors work more easily when the target is the following sibling.
It does not affect the document semantically.

* When the `input` gets `focus`, the CSS selector moves the `label`.
The `transition` defined on the `label` provides the animation.

* If an `id` is passed in, it will be used for the `input`.  If not, the lodash function will generate an `id` for us.
An `id` is not required for positioning the `label`, but linking the `input` and `label` is good for accessibility.

* A class is added by the `JSX` if the `input` has a value.
The CSS positions the `label` to the corner if the `input` is selected, or if it has a value.

* It is in React Memo.
This is because I add Memo by default, since I expect renders to be much more costly than property comparisons.

### Why use React instead of a pure CSS solution

There are other approaches which provide the same result.  
They tend to rely on [valid selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:valid)
and [after pseudo elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after).

These approaches can be quite convoluted.
If React is already being used, it is very natural to separate the presentation in a component,
and modifying state based on whether it has content is built into the React paradigm.
